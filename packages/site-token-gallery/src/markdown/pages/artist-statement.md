Consciousness scrambles to overlay raw perception with neat categorical symbols, keeping space and time organized and recognizable. My art explores how these mechanisms break down and can be exploited.

I paint abstract digital landscapes from exotic universes. Using patterns of light carved in space I bootstrap transient realities that wildly oscillate until reaching some steady-state in a process more like discovery than creation.

My paintings are crypto-native, an [experiment][bval] within the envelope of an exciting new way to think about how we can all thrive, together, as a digital society.

It's exciting to be building a very small part of a very large story.
