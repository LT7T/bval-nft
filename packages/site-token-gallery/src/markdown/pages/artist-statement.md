Consciousness scrambles to overlay raw perception with neat categorical symbols, keeping space and time organized and recognizable. My art explores how these mechanisms break down and can be exploited.

I paint abstract digital landscapes from exotic universes. Using patterns of light carved in space I bootstrap transient realities that wildly oscillate until reaching some steady-state in a process more like discovery than creation.

My paintings are crypto-native, an [experiment][bval] within the envelope of an exciting new way to think about how we can all thrive, together, as a digital society.

It's exciting to be building a very small part of a very large story.

## Process

I create all of my digital paintings on an iPad Pro + Apple Pencil in an app called [Procreate](https://procreate.art). I export uncompressed PNG files at their original resolution and make those files publicly available on the token detail page for each piece on this site and in the ERC-721 JSON Metadata associated with each token.

My NFT metadata and resampled images are prepared via a [custom script](https://github.com/bvalosek/bval-nft) I run locally that results in [uploading files to IPFS](/ipfs) and my tokens are minted in a custom ERC-721 smart contract via a small React app.

See the [Project Info](/project) page for more general information.
