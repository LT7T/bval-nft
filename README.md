## Goals

I started this project as I dove into the world of crypto, with the following goals:

* Explore the world of crypto art and smart contracts
* Create a scalable and durable way to distribute and represent my art
* Deploy a powerful and flexible smart contract that is compatible with all major marketplaces
* Build cool web3 applications to showcase and interact with my art
* Understand how traditional cloud platforms can interact with on-chain events and data
* Connect with others in the crypto art space
